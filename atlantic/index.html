<p class = "p1"><a href="text_ocean.html">text_ocean</a> is an experiment in random access reading and text visualization, 
using Herman Melville's notoriously impenetrable whalefishery epic "Moby Dick" as 
source material. The body of the text is blown apart and becomes a dynamic sea of words, 
animated according to grammatical function.</p>

<p class = "p1">The user explores the text by diving into the depths or surfacing, using the up and down
arrow keys. The user "reads" the text by clicking to hook an intriguing word as it drifts 
or darts past.  When a word is hooked, the other words belonging to its line are also 
slowly pulled in, and assemble, if reluctantly, to be read. </p>

<p class = "p1">Pressing "return" will release the words into the sea, but each time a word is unhooked, 
its connection to its original line of text may be lost. A wild unhooked word may 
find another line to swim with; the text is slowly, randomly rewritten by the 
user, word by word, as it is read. </p>

from New Radio and Performing Arts. thanks to Don Miller for encouragement and assistance.</p>
