What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , 
he was to me , as yet remains unsaid . 
Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , 
which could not but occasionally awaken in any man ' s soul some 
alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror 
concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered 
all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that 
I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form . It was the 
whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me . But how 
can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , 
explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught . 
Though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances 
beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , 
japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way 
recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , 
grand old kings of Pegu placing the title " Lord of the White 
Elephants " above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; 
and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped 
in the royal standard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one 
figure of a snow white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire , 
Caesarian , heir to overlording Rome , having for the imperial color the 
same imperial hue ; and though this pre eminence in it applies to the 
human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every 
dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even 
made significant of gladness , for among the Romans a white stone 
marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and 
symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble 
things the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among 
the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was 
the deepest pledge of honor ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies 
the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge , and contributes 
to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk white steeds ; 
though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it 
has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by 
the Persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the 
holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself 
being made incarnate in a snow white bull ; and though to the noble 
Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far 
the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful 
creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great 
Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though 
directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive 
the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn 
beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish 
faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion 
of our Lord ; though in the Vision of St . John , white robes are given 
to the redeemed , and the four and twenty elders stand clothed in white 
before the great white throne , and the Holy One that sitteth there 
white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with 
whatever is sweet , and honorable , and sublime , there yet lurks an 
elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes 
more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood . 
This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , 
when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any 
object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest 
bounds . Witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of 
the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the 
transcendent horrors they are ? That ghastly whiteness it is which 
imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , 
to the dumb gloating of their aspect . So that not the fierce fanged 
tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the 
white shrouded bear or shark . * 
* With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him 
who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the 
whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable 
hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , 
it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the 
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the 
fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing 
together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear 
frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . But even assuming all 
this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not 
have that intensified terror . 
As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in 
that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies 
with the same quality in the Polar quadruped . This peculiarity is most 
vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish . 
The Romish mass for the dead begins with " Requiem eternam " ( eternal 
rest ) , whence Requiem denominating the mass itself , and any other 
funeral music . Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of 
death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French 
call him Requin .
